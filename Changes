Revision history for RPi-I2C

2.3602  2017-06-23
        - completely changed the way we work. We do not use wiringPi for this
          anymore due to lack of options
        - major POD overhaul
        - added several examples using I2C to an Arduino (Trinket Pro or Uno).
          This provides examples for nearly every function. Internally in the
          Arduino sketch, on the write functions, we save the data to EEPROM,
          where the data can be fetched back out at a certain register to make
          comparisons on (this functionality will be incorporated into the
          RPi::WiringPi unit test suite)

2.3601  2017-06-22
        - First version, released on an unsuspecting world.
